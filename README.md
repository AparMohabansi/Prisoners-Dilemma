# Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma

This repository contains an implementation of the Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma, developed for the **CSE 404 - Introduction to Machine Learning** final project.

## Overview

The Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is a classic problem in game theory, where two players repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, making decisions to cooperate or defect over multiple rounds. This simulation explores various strategies and their interactions, providing insight into concepts such as cooperation, competition, and adaptive behavior.

## Features

- Simulation of the Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma with configurable rounds and strategies
- Implementation of common strategies, such as Tit-for-Tat, Always Cooperate, Always Defect, and others
- Analysis of outcomes across different strategy pairings
- Easily extendable to add new strategies or adjust game parameters

## Research Paper

A detailed analysis and discussion of the project, including experimental results, is available in the research paper:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AparMohabansi/Prisoners-Dilemma.git
cd Prisoners-Dilemma
```

Install any required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the main simulation script:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can modify parameters, strategy selections, or extend the project as needed for your experiments.
